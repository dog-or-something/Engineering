            1/19/24 - This is my first update for the second semester! I can sart anew and I'm able to have more shenanigans of the engineering kind. This week, I learned about chemical engineering and experimented with non-Newtonian fluids out in the parking lot. It was fun for sure, but my hands were freezing by the time I took them out of the fluid and let the wind dry my hands. Great class experiment nonetheless, and now I'm making an Arduino car with my friend, so now I need to put electrical and software engineering along with physics and design into a single project.

            1/26/24 - This is my second update for the second semester! I started a group project with the ultimate Lima, to create an Arduino car! Here's the catch though; we're planning on turning it into a tank! That means we can craete another motor system to operate a NON FUNCTIONING turret with a sensor somewhere inside of it, and control it remotely instead of doing the bare minimum of running code to have it run in a predetermined path. Our design is loosely going to be based on the British prototype TOG 2. That means it will be long and tread-operated. That means we can create a more grippy surface between the tank and the ground, and not have to use CD's as oversized wheels. Now, for next week, Ethan and I have to find a way to get a proper tread system 3D printed, and then we can move on to improving circuitry.

            2/5/24 - This is my third update for the second semester! I was able to finish the CAD for my basic tank shell, and Ethan and I found a viable premade CAD file for our tank treads! If the prints go smoothly, the rest of the week can go to refining the Aruino and motor control software, along with drilling holes for the motors to give space for the treads on the outside. Hopefully Ethan can get the printer up and running for the main prints. Even if we have to rush and use the prototype as the final, our design is already refined enough that we can just drill holes for the motors, and a sensor to control the tank remotely. Now for what I did over the weekend is... a good question. I don't know what I did, myself. I called with my friends on Discord for a few hours, and I took a bi-literacy test for Korean at Toll Middle, but otherwise, I slept, called my friends, and feared the rain.

            2/13/24 - This is my fourth update for the second semester! The day before Valentine's day, still single, but I do have a 3D printing pen, which will help a lot with repairing any parts that break while Ethan and I build over the week. Not too eventful of a week, since Ethan and I were figuring out how Arduino code worked, and how to get a proper print going. Still need to work on the smaller bits of printing, since the original print is hungolomghononoloughongous

            2/26/24 - This is my fifth update for the second semester! The project was horrendously hard to deal with in terms of 3d modeling and coding. Arduino is so new to me, even as I write this update. Ethan Lima still despises Tinkercad, as do I. The treads needed a little bit more help getting traction, and using a long cord to connect the Arduino so we can control it from a foot away like a leash wasn't working due to the code being funky, so we didn't get much distance either. We just went in a loop around a tight circle. That led to the car performing decently in defense in terms of PVP fighting though, so it wasn't all that bad! We couldn't really make a prototype since the process of finding out how to get stubborn old Tinkercad to work and learning how C++ worked was a lengthy challenge, but if Ethan L and I were to make another version, most likely we'd have direct contact between the driving gear and the wheels, because we needed a bit more friction to drive our little contraption. I learned that C++ is extremely different from Java, and Tinkercad needs a revamp in terms of useability for precise models.

            3/4/24 - This is my sixth update for the second semester! We got a new project! And new groups! My new group is nice. They aren't that rowdy which is a relief. We have to replicate an egg drop off of the third floor of the 1000 building. My group is planning to support the egg with straws to hold it in the center, and have cotton and other filling around it to keep it near the center if it falls out. Of course, we need to add two garbage bags as parachutes, and two balloons to try and slow the package down. I feel like using a hole in the garbage bag's center would keep the package upright and slow while it comes down, but I don't know if three floors is enough to see adequate results. If we have a method of reducing forces by having an elastic material such as the balloon around it, it would be optimal since the impulse of the system would be more spread out and therefore less force on the shell of the egg. The weakest part of the build has to be the straw supports of the egg. If that fails, I don't know what will happen. Maybe we can change it and back up our changes with physics, or we change it and hope for the best. Either way, I'm betting my group does well on this project.

            3/13/24 - This is my sixth update for the second semester! I got a pretty good group for my egg drop project, but due to a lack of tape and time, we couldn't 100% save our egg. If we had some extra time to tape/tie the entire box together for our egg, we likely would've prevented the slight lobotomy we gave it. Otherwise, it was funny to watch our project become a pinata. I learned that I need to manage groups a bit better as well, since some of us weren't working 100% of the time. If I can work on managing people better and ensuring they know what to do, even if I'm not there, the project would've been alright. Otherwise, cool to watch everyone try out their egg drops. Now that that's over though, I can move on to spring break. I plan on going to Las Vegas for the weekend, and once I'm back, I can go goof off with my friends at their houses, the park, or whatever we feel like. All that matters is that school is out of the way for the most part!

            3/29/24 - This is my sixth update for the second semester! My break was great! I was in Vegas for a few days and I got to take a break from California! I got to go see Red Rock Canyon and have good food. Now that I'm back at school, I have to make a boat with Eron, and it will be absolutely miniscule. Even with the small size, I think we can get the boat around 2/3 of the 500cm distance. The biggest hinderance was getting the boat to be under 7x14 cm and having it look interesting, while also using only the provided materials. Now that there's only 10 weeks of school left, I want to get my physics grades up, and make sure to get all of the contact information from my friends possible so I don't lose contact over break.

            4/4/24 - This is my seventh update for the second semester! For the past two weeks, my class was working on making a small model boat to sail across a small drain. Since my parter Eron was absent for the majority of the project, I somewhat gave up on the original plan of having a cup as a boat hull to resemble a jon boat. Instead, I used two straws, card paper, two paperclips, and two post-it notes to make an emergency raft, an American flag, and a sail. I could've made the boat more wide and given it more sails to give it more travel distance per gust of wind. On the topic of projects, my favorite throughout the year was the aerospace bottle rocket. Even though I didn't get to choose who I worked with, the end result was fun, even if my group's rocket didn't go very far. My least favorite would have to be the RC car, but with a caveat. If Ethan and I had a little more time to get a proper CAD and get a working traction system for the tank treads, along with code that wasn't so finicky and new to the both of us, the project would've been perfect. But that isn't the point of the project, so the overall experience of having to understand Arduino code while Ethan and I tried to work on 3d modeling functional prints was absolutely infuriating. Onto a lighter topic, for this weekend, I'm most likely planning on having some fun on Roblox with my friends and being on caffeine for half of it.

            4/15/24 - This is my eigth update for the second semester! I now have a final project for the year. My group and I have to make a cardboard boat only using cardboard and duct tape. With this in mind, I think the group would be best off with a trimaran design, since it offers stability and spreads the weight of the boat more evenly. I look forward to finding a method of making a successful trimaran design. On Thursday of last week, I partnered with Diego to make a post-it bridge as long as possible, only using post-its, and nothing else. Diego and I got around 12 feet of distance by overlapping post-it notes and having them cut in half to double the distance. Other than that, I look forward to ending the year, being done with all my AP classes and having no school work for two months. This means I can work at a job, get money, and hopefully get a decent amout of money saved up to invest.

            4/22/24 - This is my ninth update for the second semester! My group is now able to create pontoon supports for the trimaran design. So far, we've created a way to budget tape, and now have an opportunity to secure more cardboard for our precious project. My group was also able to label and secure pontoon sections, while also having main hull floors. The main challenge for my group is getting enough cardboard to have actual walls for the boat. I don't see many problems coming up, since my group has a system for recording and budgetting tape, while we also have a system for measuring and cutting cardboard. I'm excited for my upcoming AP Computer Science exam, since it's a topic I have a genuine interest in. AP Physics is more nerve-wracking than fun, unless I actually understand the topic, equation for equation. To talk about a stereotype that I fit in, I don't know which ones I fit in to, but I feel like people assume I'm smart because of how many AP classes I take. In reality, I'm quite low-level and incapable of doing many things. I don't think my intelligence is the highest, but it definitely something I suppose.

            5/6/24 - This is my tenth update for the second semester! My group finished both of the side pontoons for our boat. Now we need to measure out side portions for our boat. Once that's done, my group has to get our rods of cardboard together and connect all of the pontoons together. I'm concerned a bit about stability for our boat, so we will likely have sideways planks to make sure the boat doesn't cave in on itself. On the argument of apple vs orange juice, orange juice is the clear winner. Orange juice mixes well with cranberry juice and Sprite. It takes the win. What else is there to say? It's a juice that describes its own color. Apple juice isn't apple colored, is it? Your drink opinions are invalid if you think apple juice can mix with more drinks than orange juice. Apple Fanta? Never heard of that. Orange Fanta? Hi-C? Orange-cream soda? Hello? Wake up. Orange juice is so much better than apple juice.

            5/13/24 - This is my eleventh update for the second semester! My group is nearly complete with making the boat. All we need to do is get the sides of the boat attached, and we need to attach the side pontoons to the main boat. Then, we have to tape our paddles together and we're set to sail. For mother's day, my family all went out golfing and then had shrimp and crawfish for lunch. Back with the boat, my group is super close to finishing. Likely we can finish within a handful of class periods, if not around 2.

            5/20/24 - This is my twelvth and final update for the second semester! WE RAN OUT OF TAPE. Not nice. Mr. Poole got us an extra roll for the price of an unknown amount of points, but I'm hoping that the group can improve the boat by using this tape. The boat is almost done, since my group just has to attach the braces to the main and secondary hulls. I don't have any big opinions on changing the curriculum for this course, since I don't mind working in individual and group projects. I would like to see less people goofing around in class, but that's the students, and not the curriculum. Teaching students more about safety around equipment might be useful, but I don't know if everyone would pay attention, especially those who need to hear the safety info the most.

            For the summer, I want to get a job at a retail store, or as a data entry clerk for a company, so I can invest money into some stocks, or to buy technology I want to test out, like VR headsets.

            For finals, I doubt that my exams will be difficult, but it sure will be tedious, since I'm now finished with AP exams, and lessons are slowing down. For computer science, my Discord bot is going along smoothly. For AP precalculus, there's a test this upcoming Friday. For English, my class has to make common apps in preparation for next year. For peer tutoring, of course there's no finals. In history, there's a group project that I have a wonderful group for, and I have a final test that I feel confident in doing well in. For AP physics, I have a quiz coming up on next Friday, related to buoyancy and fluid motion. Then, I have a units quiz as a final. For engineering, I've heard that we have a movie to watch, but I don't know which one. Finals overall shouldn't be too bad, but I definitely feel some pressure to keep going.

            In terms of final notes, I would like to thank you, Mr. Poole, for being a great teacher this year, not just for computer science, but also for this class, engineering. You made a fun curricular that keeps me entertained, and your leniency makes me feel like I can relax in this class a lot more than other classes, where I feel pressure to perform at 110% all day long. You made projects fun and useful in terms of practical applications, and you've made good grades easy to achieve. Thank you so much for making junior year easier for me. I appreciate what you've done for everyone this year!
